   The CC/iC Blender Tools addon is a versatile tool to handle character exports from Character Creator or iClone.  Its features include the following:



   - The ability to edit/correct meshes.

   - Easy Introduction of accessory items to a character.

   - Simplified editing of PhysX weight maps by painting the maps directly onto the character model using Blender's internal weight painting facilities.

   - Easy introduction of physics and weight maps onto items that dont have physics enabled

   - Use of the pipeline addon to return the above to Character Creator.

   file length limitation on pipeline exports

   export back to CC n the same directory as you (pipeline) exported to - this will allow the relative paths used by the return trip (textures arent duplicated) to be shorter
